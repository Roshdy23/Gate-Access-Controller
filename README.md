# License Plate Detection

This project leverages OpenCV and Python to detect license plates from images. The program processes an image to identify the license plate area using various image processing techniques.

## Features

- Image preprocessing to enhance the detection of license plates.
- Detection of license plates within an image.
- Allows dynamic specification of the image to be processed using command-line arguments.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
