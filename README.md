# **Egyptian License Plate Recognization**

This project leverages OpenCV and Python to detect license plates from images. The program processes an image to identify the license plate area using various image processing techniques.

## Features

- Image preprocessing to enhance the detection of license plates.
- Detection of license plates within an image.
- Developed a robust plate segmentation algorithm to accurately extract characters and digits from license plates under challenging conditions.
- Provides the option to select from various machine learning and deep learning models.
- Provides exclusive access to the designated vehicles only.
